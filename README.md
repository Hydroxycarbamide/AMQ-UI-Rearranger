# AMQ-UI-Rearranger
Rearrange Anime Music Quiz UI to provide more information

To install, please copy "AMQ-UI-Rearranger.js" into whatever userscript manager you like (ex: Tampermonkey). Afterwards, copy the contents of "Streaming AMQ Game UI.css" and "Streaming AMQ Lobby.css" into a User Style Manager of your choice (ex: Stylus). Alternatively, you can use "Streaming Friendly Games.css" instead of "Streaming AMQ Game UI.css" for a view that shows more information about how someone did on their list.

If you want the ability to upload your match data straight from the script, please use Tampermonkey (or GreaseMonkey 3 or change the script a bit) as the upload functionality was written using GreaseMonkey 3 syntax. After you met that requirement, please update the devKey and userKey to your pastebin values.
